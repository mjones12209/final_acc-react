# Final Project Javascript Fundamentals Remade in React

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo with:
   * `git clone https://github.com/mjones12209/final_acc-react.git`
2. Get an API Key from TMDB, more info here:
   * https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
3. Install the API Key in the src/ directory as key.js:
   ```javascript
   export const apiKey = "Your API Key";
   ```
4. You will need to have Node.js/Node Package Manager installed on your system to run/build this application. Installation instructions for Node.js and Node Package Manager can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
5. After the API key is installed, you can install dependencies for the app by running one of the following commands from the root directory of the app in a terminal:
    
    ```
    ### Linux/Mac ###

    npm install && npm start 
    ```
    ```
    ### Windows ###

    npm install & npm start 
    ```
